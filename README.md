# ReadMe for “Twitter Data Analysis to Track the Spread of Ideas”

This is the twitter sentiment analysis and visualization project conducted by Cori Williams and Grace Fan, under the supervision of Professor Susan Moffit, Cadence Willse, and Professor Ugur Centintemel. It tracks two key phrases: “#commoncore” (AKA cc) and “college and career readiness” (AKA ccr) to analyze how the public opinion on both topics has changed over time and throughout the country. 


Full abstract: 

Our work has focused on the spread of ideas related to instructional practice and content (such as sharing ideas and resources on how to teach math) and the spread of populist ideas about education standards as a vehicle for federal government control of local public schools.  Our analysis has focused on tweets from 2012-2018, using basic text analysis and sentiment analysis to assess the systematic differences between tweets referencing the Common Core (i.e. the Common Core State Standards Initiative in education) and those referencing college and career readiness standards. We have been examining how the former term has become a target and vehicle for populist antipathy and the latter term has become a vehicle for sharing information on.
